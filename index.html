            <p>I began shooting 35mm film in April of 2022. At the time, I was working at an archive that specialized in fine art photography as well as photojournalism in late 20th century N.Y.C. </p>
            <p>Photography has since grown into a consistent practice for me, and by embracing experimentation and the inevitability of "mistakes" (not to mention the support and guidance of other young female photographers), my work has continued to improve. 
            <p>Recently, I've begun taking on paid gigs from musician friends, and am looking forward to how my photo practice might grow.</p>
            <p>What I lack in technical expertise - for now, at least - I hope to make up with a healthy intuition, what they call a "good eye", and a passion for learning.</p>
            <p>This website contains some examples of my work as well as other influences and inspirations. I hope you enjoy it. </p>
