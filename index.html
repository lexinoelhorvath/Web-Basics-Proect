            I began shooting 35mm film in April of 2022. At the time, I was working at an archive that specialized in fine art photography as well as photojournalism in late 20th century NYC as featured in the West Village's Village Voice. Photography has since grown into a consistent practice for me, and by embracing experimentation and the inevitability of "mistakes" - not to mention the support and guidance of other young female photographers UTF-8 my work has continued to improve. I recently began taking on paid gigs from musician friends, and am looking forward to how my practice might grow from here. What I may lack in technical expertise (for now) I hope to make up with a natural eye and an openness to learning. This website contains some examples of my work as well as other influences and inspirations. I hope you enjoy it.
